                       <Card title="James Hardie & Vinyl Siding Specialist" description="James Hardie siding is over five times thicker than vinyl, allowing for deeper grooves and a more authentic wood-grain effect.

                       <Card title="Gutter" description="Your gutters are responsible for water management. During a storm, they effectively channel water flow from your roof, through the downspouts, and direct it to appropriate areas outside the home. Without a gutter system, your roof can pick up a bunch of leaves and other debris, causing water to stagnate and overflow. This can make your home vulnerable to rotting, rusting, and other damage."></Card>
                       <Card title="Gutter & Leaf Guard" description="All gutters carry water away from your home, but only LeafGuard does it with a unique, patented one-piece debris-shedding design that is better than any other gutter system on the market today. LeafGuard gutters work on a simple but powerful scientific principle known as liquid adhesion. This allows rainwater to travel around the hood and into the gutter, while deflecting leaves and other debris to never clog."></Card>
                       <Card title="Leaf Filters" description="LeafFilter Gutter Guard System. LeafFilter's gutter protection system uses a tightly spaced micro-mesh screen to draw in water without flushing debris through your home's gutter system. Using surface tension, the water penetrates the screen while pushing most debris away."></Card>

             <p>After Lee Chavous became a father a few years ago, he soon found himself worrying about his son's prospective education. He knew that the formative years are critical, and that the history books tend to marginalize, overlook, or inaccurately recount the contributions of African-Americans. Congrats to concerned papa Lee Chavous for publishing the first in what is likely to prove to be a priceless series of sensible supplements to the traditional American History textbooks.</p>

             <p>These are interesting historical manuscripts.  I learned a lot of new things that I did not know about Africa.  A magnificent job of research, and this is a lot of history that chronicles from Africa to America, as well as other places.  I wish that every school in America would adopt these texts.  If they do not, they should be placed in the library so that individuals would be allowed to use them whenever they are available.</p>
